# Data Analytics App
### Assignment #4: Python-Based Data Analytics Application Deployment


## Objective
The aim of this project is to create a Python-based data analytics application and set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline will handle building, testing, deploying, and monitoring the application with tools like Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), and Jenkins.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Minikube (Kubernetes)
- **CI/CD Tool**: Jenkins
- **Testing Tools**: Pytest, Selenium (optional for UI testing)
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible or Chef
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch (optional)

---


## Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. GitHub Setup
- Create a GitHub repository to host the project.
- Set up folders for source code, tests, data, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation.
- Add a sample dataset in the `data` folder.

### 2. Develop the Python Application
- Build a Python application with modular, reusable code.
- Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- Implement key data analytics features.

### 3. Containerization
- Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the app using a lightweight Python base image.
- Include dependencies and ensure the application is ready to deploy.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
- Automate the workflow with Jenkins:
  - Build the Python app and install dependencies.
  - Run unit tests to ensure correctness.
  - Build and push the Docker image.
  - Deploy the app to Kubernetes.

### 5. Testing
- Write unit tests with Pytest to validate the analytics functionality.
- Optionally, write Selenium tests for any web-based interfaces.

### 6. Deploy with Minikube
- Deploy the app to a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
- Write Kubernetes manifests for deployment and services.

### 7. Configuration Management
- Use Ansible or Chef to automate server and app setup tasks.
- Set up Docker, Kubernetes, and deploy manifests.

### 8. Monitoring (Optional)
- Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor the application.
- Visualize performance metrics and logs.
